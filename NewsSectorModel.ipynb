But experts believe electrification of all the routes may not be possible.\n",
      "Index : 792, Value : Past shots at Chinese solar imports have misfired. A new duty regime could hurt Make in India. The current safeguard duty on solar-module imports has failed to cheer domestic manufacturing or cut reliance on China. The proposed customs duty is unlikely to help either. Solar panels and cells made in SEZs, which account for half of the domestic production, will become costly, and, therefore, uncompetitive against cheap imports.\n",
      "Index : 793, Value : Deep discounts with 1-hour delivery: inside real-time power trading and why it can light up discoms IEX and PXIL have started real-time trading of power. The new system allows discoms to buy power a lot cheaper, according to their dayâ€™s requirement, and just an hour before they need it. They can save up to INR550 crore annually. The new mechanism will also help integrate higher quantum of renewable energy resources into the grid.\n",

Its refiners and oil marketers canâ€™t benefit from a benign crude as there is no demand in the economy due to lockdown. In fact, they are facing margin squeeze and heavy inventory losses. Upstream companies stare at low realisation per barrel and 80%-90% dip in profit.\n",
      "Index : 798, Value : Crude oil prices are raining gold. Can India put out the bucket? Three factors hold the key. With crude oil trading at record lows, itâ€™s an opportune time for India to build its strategic reserves. But considering the tight fisc, funding could be a challenge. Also, a slowing economy may not have the appetite to consume high volumes of oil in the short term. Will this be another missed opportunity?\n",
      "Index : 799, Value : Indiaâ€™s fuel-retail market is likely to get brutal with more players expected to join the fray Analysts expect the incumbents and newbies to fight the impending battle in cities and towns to own customers who consume diesel, a fuel that comprises 40% of Indiaâ€™s total oil demand. What could turn the battle fiercer is the rise of natural gas-driven vehicles and electric vehicles aided by the governmentâ€™s policy thrust and technological innovations.\n",
      "Index : 800, Value : Coronavirus-hit China triggers an unprecedented slide in global oil demand. It can help India. Global crude-oil demand may just collapse in 2020. As the global economy faces a likely recession, crude prices have gone into a tailspin, sinking over 30% this year. Still, it helps India â€“ cuts the mammoth import bill, keeps fuel inflation in check, and RBI can sustain a soft interest-rate regime to boost growth. But first: the Modi government must contain the coronavirus.\n",
      "Index : 801, Value : No coal-power plant in India by 2050? Possible, only if it can put its renewables plan in place. The country is facing a glut in power-generation capacity, with plants either underutilised or lying idle, especially in coal-based power. Moreover, foreign investors are willing to finance only green projects, and the government also has set a massive target for renewables. Does this signal the end of capacity addition in coal-based generation?\n",

While this can help India save precious dollars in oil imports, the lack of processing plants across the country remains a challenge.\n",
      "Index : 805, Value : ReNew Power, Greenko, et al. eye transmission heft amid low tariff. Caution: avoid aggressive bids Compared to other segments in the power chain, transmission is a low-risk business with a prolonged asset life and higher payment security. There is room for more players to come in as only three companies operate in power transmission. But irrational bidding for projects could lead to losses and create a debt trap.\n",
      "Index : 806, Value : Thermal power is pushed to a corner. What got it here? Overzealous forecasts and tepid demand After gas-based power plants entailing INR1 lakh crore investment, coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 50,000MW could become stranded. Power-sector insiders say illogical forecasts by the CEA have resulted in overcapacity. Adding to the woes are the lack of assured fuel supply and agreements to sell power, besides the governmentâ€™s focus on solar power.\n",
      "Index : 807, Value : India to set up gas exchange for market-linked pricing. Caution: deregulation has its own perils. Indian Gas Exchange will be similar to international gas-trading hubs â€“ Henry Hub in the US or UKâ€™s National Balancing Point. The advocates of free pricing believe it will encourage foreign players to invest in exploration and extraction of gas. This will also help bring the prices in line with international markets.\n",

Early adopters say their income has substantially increased and their productivity has gone up manifold. But mass adoption will only happen once banks and financial institutions warm up to the concept and the ecosystem sets a quality benchmark.\n",

A lack of land and transmission infrastructure Solar parks account for 40% of the governmentâ€™s target to build 100GW of solar-power capacity by 2022. However, faced with land-acquisition problems and transmission challenges, the target is unlikely to be achieved.\n",
      "Index : 810, Value : India wants better price and security: why Tapi may not reach its destination Supply via the Tapi pipeline could fulfil 30%-35% of Indiaâ€™s gas requirements. But the country finds the landed price of Turkmen gas at USD10 per mmBtu too high. Also, concern over Pakistan cutting supply in case of a conflict is holding back India from going full throttle on the project. The alternative: US gas.\n",
      "Index : 811, Value : With a 12-day oil reserve, a lingering Saudi crisis could hurt India. What could help? US supplies If supplies from the worldâ€™s biggest crude-processing facility are not restored in two weeks, India will have to worry. While the government will have the option to increase its imports from the US, the higher cost will put pressure on its already-strained finances.\n",
      "Index : 812, Value : The government makes broke power discoms accountable. Itâ€™s now time for tariff reforms. In order to reform the ailing power sector in India, the government has directed embattled distribution companies to maintain letters of credit to ensure timely payment to generation utilities. But it could mean a spike in debt and losses for discoms, disrupting power supplies. The time has come for a long-overdue tariff correction.\n",

      "Index : 816, Value : Indiaâ€™s new energy policy: Find more allies for cheaper, superior hydrocarbon commodities India is reaching out to more geographies for sourcing hydrocarbons. This strategy is dictated by several factors â€” from access to cheaper commodities, given trade agreements with regional blocks, to the need for higher-quality and environmental-friendly ones.\n",
      "Index : 817, Value : Hostility to Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative can thwart Indiaâ€™s solar-energy ambitions China is spearheading a movement to build a globally interconnected smart grid that can connect solar channels across borders.

      "Index : 819, Value : Dear Jagan Reddy: 5,000MW of renewable capacity is at stake. Itâ€™s no more a who-blinks-first game. Defying the Centre, Andhra Pradesh has decided to revisit solar and wind power purchase contracts. Given the weak funding atmosphere, any misstep such as renegotiation of contracts will not only unsettle the renewable-energy sector but also magnify project risks.\n",

      "Index : 821, Value : Floating an idea: If land is a hurdle for solar-power projects, how about putting them on water? In India, where land availability often nixes solar plans, floating solar-power plants offer a viable solution. While they have their unique design challenges and are more expensive to instal, they are more efficient than solar plants on land. Moreover, they help conserve a vital resource â€” water.\n",

      "Index : 826, Value : The PFC-REC merger is stuck because the government wants both cash and control. So? Bend the rules. If the definition of â€˜public-sector unitâ€™ is changed, it would be easier for the government to reduce stake in them and still remain in charge. Disinvestment then will remain a fund-raising exercise and ceding management control in most PSUs will almost be off the table.\n",

      "Index : 1266, Value : In its duel with rising debt, KEC International is banking on strong project execution to win the day While the RPG group company hopes that its cost of funds will come down as the market stabilises, a potential 1.2x-1.4x rise in the debt-to-equity ratio by the end of FY19 could mark the end of the companyâ€™s low-leveraged dream run.\n",
      "Index : 1267, Value : IL&FS: charismatic leader, complex structures, and a gullible ecosystem The companyâ€™s deep troubles reveal how financial chicanery is easy to pull off, and for a long period of time. All that is needed is to get to a situation where a firm is too big to fail.\n",
      "Index : 1268, Value : The hidden cracks in L&T The construction and engineering giantâ€™s robust balance sheet conceals a vital concern: that its dream run might grind to a halt if it doesnâ€™t address overdependence on domestic contracts and a sluggish order book.\n",
      "Index : 1269, Value : India's notoriously inefficient tolling system is getting smarter Global private-equity and investment firms are moving into the stodgy business.\n",
      "Index : 1270, Value : The long wait for light at the end of Zojila tunnel: Donâ€™t blame only developers. Indiaâ€™s bidding criteria for roads are faulty too. With cost overruns of INR1.45 lakh crore, one theme runs across Indiaâ€™s public-infrastructure projects â€” poor implementation rate and quality. An overhaul of the tendering process may make our roads less bumpy.\n",
      "Index : 1271, Value : FASTag makes highway journeys joyful. It is also turning out to be a happy business model. Armed with goodies, the government is aiming to make electronic toll collection attractive for both commercial fleet operators and individual vehicle owners.\n",
      "Index : 1272, Value : Can Dilip Buildcon ride out the storm? The dream run of the stock suffered a sudden jolt in May-end, when it corrected over 25% in the span of two days. The company has a unique strategy to execute projects, but the latest turn of events has prompted investors to put its financials under scrutiny.\n",
      "Index : 1273, Value : L&T takes the road less travelled for its InvIT The infrastructure major, unlike its peers, is betting only on institutional investors and not the retail guys for its infrastructure investment trust.\n",
      "Index : 1274, Value : Bharatmala heads for a bumpy ride The government's showpiece infrastructure project aims to build 34,000 km of roads at a mammoth capital outlay. But three big hurdles are set to make the journey a tough one.\n"
