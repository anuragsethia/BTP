      "Index : 792, Value : Past shots at Chinese solar imports have misfired. A new duty regime could hurt Make in India. The current safeguard duty on solar-module imports has failed to cheer domestic manufacturing or cut reliance on China. The proposed customs duty is unlikely to help either.

With crude oil trading at record lows, itâ€™s an opportune time for India to build its strategic reserves. But considering the tight fisc, funding could be a challenge.

      "Index : 800, Value : Coronavirus-hit China triggers an unprecedented slide in global oil demand. It can help India. Global crude-oil demand may just collapse in 2020. As the global economy faces a likely recession, crude prices have gone into a tailspin, sinking over 30% this year. Still, it helps India â€“ cuts the mammoth import bill, keeps fuel inflation in check, and RBI can sustain a soft interest-rate regime to boost growth. But first: the Modi government must contain the coronavirus.\n",
      "Index : 801, Value : No coal-power plant in India by 2050? Possible, only if it can put its renewables plan in place. The country is facing a glut in power-generation capacity, with plants either underutilised or lying idle, especially in coal-based power. Moreover, foreign investors are willing to finance only green projects, and the government also has set a massive target for renewables.
